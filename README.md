### Installing Sura

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Slim.

```bash
$ composer require sura/sura:^0.1.0
```

<a name="configuration"></a>
### Configuration

#### Public Directory

After installing Sura, you should configure your web server's document / web root to be the `public` directory. The `index.php` in this directory serves as the front controller for all HTTP requests entering your application.

#### Configuration Files

All of the configuration files for the Sura framework are stored in the `config` directory.


<a name="urls"></a>
### URLs

#### Apache

Sura includes a `public/.htaccess` file that is used to provide URLs without the `index.php` front controller in the path. Before serving Sura with Apache, be sure to enable the `mod_rewrite` module so the `.htaccess` file will be honored by the server.

If the `.htaccess` file that ships with Sura does not work with your Apache installation, try this alternative:
```
    Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes
    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```
#### Nginx

If you are using Nginx, the following directive in your site configuration will direct all requests to the `index.php` front controller:
```
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }
```
